We have created a ChatBot with the help of a Open source Software which creates a chatbot (we have to add all the necessary features to it ) and it is also ai based so that if user asks any other questions except for the hackathon topic it gives them some type of answer. As it is integrated with Chat gpt4 version. Now we have just made a website and with all the necessary info and tabs for the user so that they can access the data.
